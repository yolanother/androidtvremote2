# Project Code Rules

## ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `docs/Planning.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `docs/Tasks.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `docs/Planning.md`.

## ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Keep all code files as short and modular as possible.** Break code blocks into modules, components, hooks, contexts, or whatever modular component makes sense for the code being worked on.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** that follow the project's established patterns.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability
- **Always create unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, update them.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main application structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

## âœ… Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `docs/Tasks.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `docs/Tasks.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section.
- **When completing a task, create a git commit** with a meaningful message.
  - Store the commit message in a `.gitignored` file named `LastChange.md`
  - Include a descriptive title and additional details in the lines following the title
  - Ensure git log entries are safe to be submitted on a bash shell
  - Use: `git commit -F -` with the commit message piped in

## ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions
- **Follow the language's established style guide** and formatting conventions.
- **Use type hints or type annotations** when supported by the language.
- **Use appropriate data validation libraries** for the project's language.
- **Use established frameworks** for the project as specified in `docs/Planning.md`.
- Write **documentation for every function, method, and class** using the language's conventional format.

## ðŸ“š Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Update documentation files** including `Planning.md`, `Design.md`, and/or `Tasks.md` as designs, tasks, and plans change.
  - Only update these files after completing a git commit or a task
  - When marking tasks as complete, include the git commit hash if available
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline comment explaining the reasoning** behind the implementation, not just what it does.

## ðŸ§  Development Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never use libraries or functions** that aren't explicitly documented as being used in the project.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `docs/Tasks.md`.

When you are commiting. The message should be stored in a .gitignored file LastChange.md. Include a description of the change in the lines following the commit title. Pipe that log into git commit -F -. When you update LastChange.md completely rewrite the file, it should only have the last set of changes.

At the end of a task, instead of printing the summary just add that content to the diff commit message and update the TAsks.md and and Planning.md docs. If there are updates to tasks, new tasks are thought of or existing tasks need updates make sure to do it as the need arrives.

Maintain a docs/Utilities.md script for any utility scripts you've created. Reference that doc for command line actions you may need to run. When you create utilities in this scripts directory optimize them for the information you need to do those tasks.

Remember you are running with git bash on windows when executing scripts and command line operations..

As you work on a set of tasks maintain a doc in docs that is doc/NextTasks.md. This should be a short list of the next 10 or so things you plan to do sequentially.
